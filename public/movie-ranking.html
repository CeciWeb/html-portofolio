<h1>Best movies of all time according to Cecilia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The book thief</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed this movie because it was suspenseful and its theme was based on real events.</p>

<h3>Home alone</h3>
<p>This is simply an all time classic, a movie I watch every year and I never get tired of. Family friendly to an extent.</p>

<h3>Bohemian Rhapsody</h3>
<p>An excellent movie for people who love the music of Queen, but not only. I highly recommend it.</p>
